Urgent Issue Summary  
  The ProxaPeople HR management application is experiencing a **persistent**   
  **white screen issue** after implementing comprehensive routing changes.  
  Despite multiple fix attempts, the application remains non-functional in  
  production.  
  Application Context  
  \- **Project**: ProxaPeople \- Enterprise HR Management Platform  
  \- **Architecture**: React 18 \+ TypeScript \+ Feature-Sliced Design  
  \- **Stack**: Vite \+ Wouter (routing) \+ Zustand (state) \+ TanStack Query  
  \- **Deployment**: Vercel Production  
  \- **Live URL**:  
  https://proxapeople-mu56zoyxy-nick-mangubats-projects.vercel.app  
  Recent Changes That Triggered Issue  
  1\. **Routing Overhaul**: Completely rewrote App.tsx from 2 routes to 12+  
  routes with authentication  
  2\. **Added Route Guards**: Implemented ProtectedRoute wrapper for  
  authenticated pages  
  3\. **Layout Integration**: Wrapped protected routes with MainLayout component  
  4\. **Import Path Fixes**: Resolved auth context/store conflicts  
  Investigation History  
  **Attempt 1**: Added missing route definitions \- Build succeeded, still white  
   screen  
  **Attempt 2**: Fixed import paths (@/contexts/auth-context →  
  @/app/store/auth) \- Build succeeded, still white screen**Attempt 3**:  
  Standardized auth to use Zustand store \- Build succeeded, still white  
  screen  
  Key Files to Investigate  
  1\. Main App Component  
  // client/src/App.tsx \- Recently completely rewritten  
  import { Switch, Route } from "wouter";  
  import { ProtectedRoute } from "@/features/auth/components/route-guard";  
  import MainLayout from "@/shared/ui/components/main-layout";  
  // \+ 12 page imports  
  function App() {  
    return (  
      \<div className\="min-h-screen bg-white"\>  
        \<Switch\>  
          {/\* Public Routes \*/}  
          \<Route path\="/"\>\<HomePage /\>\</Route\>  
          \<Route path\="/login"\>\<LoginPage /\>\</Route\>  
          {/\* Protected Routes with MainLayout \*/}  
          \<Route path\="/dashboard"\>  
            \<ProtectedRoute\>  
              \<MainLayout\>\<Dashboard /\>\</MainLayout\>  
            \</ProtectedRoute\>  
          \</Route\>  
          // \+ 9 more protected routes...  
        \</Switch\>  
      \</div\>  
    );  
  }  
  2\. Critical Dependencies  
  \- **Route Guard**: client/src/features/auth/components/route-guard.tsx  
  \- **Auth Store**: client/src/app/store/auth.ts (Zustand)  
  \- **Main Layout**: client/src/shared/ui/components/main-layout.tsx  
  \- **Vite Config**: vite.config.ts (path aliases)  
  3\. Architecture Notes  
  \- **Feature-Sliced Design**: Components organized by features/entities/shared  
  \- **Path Aliases**: @/ → client/src/, @/components/ui → shared/ui/components  
  \- **Authentication**: Mix of Zustand store \+ Auth0 (incomplete  
  implementation)  
  Potential Root Causes to Investigate  
  1\. Runtime JavaScript Errors  
  \# Check browser console for:  
  \- Import resolution failures  
  \- Component render errors  
  \- Authentication initialization issues  
  \- Router mounting problems  
  2\. Provider/Context Issues  
  // Check if required providers are missing in index.tsx  
  // Auth, Query, Theme providers might not be wrapping App  
  3\. Circular Dependencies  
  \# Check for circular imports in:  
  \- Auth components importing each other  
  \- Layout components  
  \- Shared utilities  
  4\. Async Loading Issues  
  // Route guards might be blocking render indefinitely  
  // Check RouteGuard loading states and fallbacks  
  5\. Build vs Runtime Differences  
  \# Development works but production doesn't?  
  \# Check for:  
  \- Environment variable differences  
  \- Vite build configuration issues  
  \- Dynamic imports failing  
  Debugging Commands  
  Local Investigation  
  \# 1\. Check local development  
  npm run dev  
  \# Open http://localhost:5173/ \- does it work locally?  
  \# 2\. Test production build locally    
  npm run build  
  npx vite preview  
  \# Open http://localhost:4173/ \- does local prod build work?  
  \# 3\. Check for TypeScript errors  
  npm run check  
  \# 4\. Check console output  
  \# Open browser dev tools → Console tab  
  \# Look for any red errors or failed network requests  
  Advanced Debugging  
  \# 1\. Test minimal App.tsx  
  \# Temporarily replace App.tsx with:  
  function App() {  
    return \<div\>Hello World\</div\>;  
  }  
  \# If this works, the issue is in routing/components  
  \# 2\. Add console.log debugging  
  \# Add logs in App.tsx, RouteGuard, MainLayout to trace execution  
  \# 3\. Check network tab  
  \# Look for failed asset loading (CSS, JS chunks)  
  Files That Might Need Attention  
  High Priority  
  1\. client/src/index.tsx \- Root render and providers  
  2\. client/src/App.tsx \- Routing logic  
  3\. client/src/features/auth/components/route-guard.tsx \- Auth blocking  
  4\. client/src/app/store/auth.ts \- Auth state initialization  
  Medium Priority  
  5\. client/src/shared/ui/components/main-layout.tsx \- Layout render issues  
  6\. vite.config.ts \- Build/import configuration  
  7\. client/src/pages/home.tsx \- Homepage component  
  8\. package.json \- Dependency conflicts  
  Previous Fix Attempts (Don't Repeat)  
  \- ✅ Added missing route definitions  
  \- ✅ Fixed import paths from contexts to stores  
  \- ✅ Standardized authentication to Zustand  
  \- ✅ Verified build succeeds  
  \- ✅ Fixed component import paths  
  Success Criteria  
  \- Homepage loads at  
  https://proxapeople-mu56zoyxy-nick-mangubats-projects.vercel.app  
  \- Dashboard accessible at /dashboard  
  \- No white screen or JavaScript errors  
  \- Authentication flow functional (if implemented)  
  \- Navigation between pages works  
  Additional Context  
  This is part of a **comprehensive enterprise overhaul** from MVP to  
  production-ready system. The infrastructure is built but integration is  
  failing. The previous working state had only a homepage route, and adding  
   the full routing system caused the white screen.

  production.
